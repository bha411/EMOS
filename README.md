#Emotional Mood Observation System(EMOS)
EMOS (Emotion detection using video) is a Python-based project that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect emotions in real-time video streams. The project employs deep learning models to recognize facial expressions and categorize them into various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. This repository contains the code and pre-trained models necessary to implement emotion detection using your webcam or video files.

Features
-Real-time emotion detection from webcam feeds.
-Support for detecting emotions in video files.
-Deep learning-based model for accurate emotion classification.
-Simple and intuitive Python interface for easy integration into your projects.
